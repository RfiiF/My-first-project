# My first project
This is my first project
So a week ago I attended a mini bootcamp on front-end developers.
The bootcamp was held for 4 days.
In the bootcamp I was taught about the basics of css, html, and javascript.
On the last day there was an assignment related to html and javascript.
I created an html program by inputting a value between 1 and 100 and later the program will display the output on the console in the form of a number value, a letter value in the form of A, B, C, D (according to the grade classification), and identify whether the value is included in an even number or an odd number.
